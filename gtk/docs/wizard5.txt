    Time to exploit!. If you want, you can decide your final code injection(s), to exploit each vulnerability founded:

        
        1)- I want to inject a classic "alert" message box with a "md5 Hash" to certificate the vulnerability.


        2)- I want to inject some scripts on my vulnerable target(s), that I will write -manually-.


        3)- I dont want to inject final code. I only want to discover vulnerabilities. :-)
