    Do you want to be as much 'anonymous' as possible?:

 
        1)- Yes. I want to enter my proxy manually and "spoof" my HTTP User Agent and HTTP Referer automatically


        2)- Anonymous?. Yes!!!!!. I have my tor proxy listening on: http://127.0.0.1:8118. 
   

        3)- Yes. but I haven't any proxy. :-)

   
        4)- No. Is not a problem for me connect directly to my target(s).
