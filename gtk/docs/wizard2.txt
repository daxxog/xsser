    Now, you need to select which class of connection(s) do you want to do with your target(s):

           
        1)- I want to connect using GET and select some possible vulnerable parameter(s) directly.


        2)- I want to connect using POST and select some possible vulnerable parameter(s) directly.


        3)- I want to "crawl" all the links of the website of my target(s), to search as much vulnerabilities as possible.


        4)- I dont know how to connect... But, do it... :-)
