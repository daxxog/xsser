    Perfect!. Now you can decide which 'bypasser(s)' do you want to use:


        1)- I want to inject XSS scripts without encoding. So, build normal injections.


        2)- Try to inject code using 'Hexadecimal' encoding.


        3)- Try to inject code mixing 'String.FromCharCode()' and 'Unescape()'.


        4)- I want to create different 'Character Encoding Mutations', manually. 


        5)- I dont know exactly what is a 'bypasser'... But, I want to inject code... :-)
